# Vagrant Tooling box

Shamelessly yoinked from James Shepherd then tweaked for my own uses this is a box that comes up with:

* Docker
* Ansible
* Packer
* Terraform
* Chef
* Git

And some QoL improvements installed.

Just to make working on windows a little better.

## Requirements

* Vagrant
* Virtualbox

## Advised tools if on Windows

* Chocolatey
* Cygwin
* Cmder
